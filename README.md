## Overview
This shield uses SIMCOM's SIM7000-series module, a low-power cellular module that supports LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT technology and integrated multi-GNSS (GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou/Compass, Galileo, QZSS standards) for location tracking. The shield can be used in different regions around the world by using the appropriate module version: SIM7000A (America), SIM7000C (China), SIM7000E (Europe), or SIM7000G (Global) as detailed on the [Github wiki](https://github.com/botletics/SIM7000-LTE-Shield/wiki/Board-Versions). The shield also includes a high-accuracy I2C temperature sensor for IoT monitoring applications. To use the shield, follow the [step-by-step wiki](https://github.com/botletics/SIM7000-LTE-Shield/wiki) to attach the headers, plug the shield into an Arduino, insert a compatible SIM card, attach the dual LTE/GPS antenna, and you're ready to load the example code!

You can [buy the shield on Amazon.com](http://a.co/d/eQ2l2TL).
